# Lecture 3: Religious vs Secular Rituals

## Understanding Rituals 
- Rituals involve social stipulation and specific sequences of actions that are often causally opaque - meaning it's unclear how the actions produce the desired outcome
- Similar to people following a recipe very closely without understanding the underlying principles
- Contrasts with non-ritual activities like brushing teeth, where we have autonomy about variation with no moral consequences

## Functions of Rituals
- Help coordinate groups and enable effective group functioning
- Create commitment between group members
- Generate sticky group coherence
- Modern psychotherapy represents a form of new age psychology

## Religious Exclusivity
- Higher positions in hierarchy provide more ability to escape norms
- Religions tend to be mutually exclusive due to:
  - Dogmatic nature
  - Competition for resources and time
  - Need for psychological stickiness
  - Organizations positioning themselves as exclusive arbiters of truth

## Modern Implications
- Secularism and science taking on identity-like status
- Moral certainty extends beyond truth claims to moral righteousness
- Topics associated with coalitions become politicized
- Even objective matters like earth's origin can become politicized
- Challenges of proper morality in collective coexistence

# Lecture 2: Cognitive Science and Religion

## Psychological Aspects of Religion
- Examines theories relevant to cognitive science as applied to religion
- Questions the psychological "stickiness" of religion
- Scientific consensus indicates we're not innately predisposed to believe in God
- However, we are predisposed to project human-like characteristics onto gods

## Divine Characteristics
- Common attributes of gods include:
  - Omniscience (all-knowing nature)
  - Moral goodness (though not universal, as seen in Greek gods)
  - Similarity to humans through anthropomorphization
  - Minimally counterintuitive nature: relatable but exceptional

## Human Psychology and Religion
- Cognitive bias leads to anthropomorphizing (projecting human qualities onto non-human entities)
- All human populations have origin stories
- Religious practices often involve transactional elements:
  - Prayer despite divine omniscience
  - Worship as sustenance for gods
  - Bargaining and sacrifice
  - Desire for prediction, order, and control

## Evolution of Religious Belief
- Religion began with local, organic practices and ancestor worship
- Ancestors viewed as imperfect and unpredictable
- Modern trends show decrease in monotheism correlates with increase in new age spirituality

## Sociological Implications
- Lower fertility rates in secular countries
- Single motherhood as significant poverty predictor
- Historical context of child marriage:
  - Agrarian necessity
  - Limited education access
  - Economic dependencies
  - Fertility emphasis
  - Social and health implications of changing marriage ages
