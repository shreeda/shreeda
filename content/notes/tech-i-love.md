    - I just lost my first pair, which were in a silver color, and instead of replacing with the new 45s, I went back for the older model. Everywhere I read says the old ones have better sound quality. 
    - I'm on the border of being an audiophile and I've been overwhelmed with feelings of grief for losing my first pair, too soon (only after 2.5 years).
