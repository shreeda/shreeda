      <description>Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</description>

      <description>Whenever someone asks me for coffee/chat/advice I normally end up saying random useless nonsense in the moment but then emailing a couple of days later saying &amp;ldquo;Actually, this book/quote/link might be useful for that thing you were wondering about.&amp;rdquo; I have a large collection of that stuff, scattered across this blog, various google docs, Pinboard and Readwise. It&amp;rsquo;s a sort of distributed commonplace book. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently wondered whether I could just dispense with the coffee stuff and share the whole collection in some useful way.</description>
