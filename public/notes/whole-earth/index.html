   <p>Whenever someone asks me for coffee/chat/advice I normally end up saying random useless nonsense in the moment but then emailing a couple of days later saying &ldquo;Actually, this book/quote/link might be useful for that thing you were wondering about.&rdquo; I have a large collection of that stuff, scattered across this blog, various google docs, Pinboard and Readwise. It&rsquo;s a sort of distributed commonplace book. I&rsquo;ve recently wondered whether I could just dispense with the coffee stuff and share the whole collection in some useful way. And I&rsquo;ve been wondering how to get it all together. I tried Scrivener, so it could be a book and Roam, so it could be networked and modern and Obsidian, so it could look like a spaceship. But none of them seemed to stick.</p>
<aside class=sidenote> Managed to get some messy margin-notes working too. Don't now how well they'll hold up over time tho. </aside>

<p>But the effect that a simple font change can have is oft-underrated, and the first step in my process usually involves finding one that fits the vibe of the project. The idea that good typography should be &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; is a <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/drowning-the-crystal-goblet.html">flawed</a> one.</p>
